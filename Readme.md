# Getting Started

### Reference Documentation
For further reference, please consider the following sections:


### Guides
The following guides illustrate how to use some features concretely:


## The coding exercise is as follows:

You are given the task of creating an application for managing games in a game service provider environment. 
The application should be developed using Java, Spring, and Maven.Define an interface called GameService to handle game-related operations (crud).

Game is a simple object with name(unique), date of creation, active.
- Implement the GameService and create a simple memory cache structure to store the games.
- Implement the GameService and create a simple memory cache structure to store the games.
- The "cache" should consider concurrency and potential performance implications.
- Exposes Rest calls, use the implemented GameService in the Spring application.
- Exposes Rest calls, use the implemented GameService in the Spring application.
- Use Maven to manage the project's dependencies. Add the necessary dependencies for Spring Boot and any other libraries required.
- Consider adding testing, logging, documentation.

This coding exercise must run and it is best to complete it in GitLab in the candidate's open account. If you could complete and send the link back to me, I can forward this to the client. 

Please, if you could complete as agreed by the End of the day on Wednesday, ready for Friday's interview at 3-4 pm - once the challenge has been completed, I will confirm the interview schedules.

I look forward to receiving your link and let me know if there are any problems/ delays.

# text exercise implementation 

- I implemented the Restful API and Client rest.  
- using spring boot 
- Restful API
- Junit for test (The tests done both to check for exceptions that the cases of correct answers).

### How to compile ?
- If you use Maven, run the following command in a terminal window (in the complete directory):
	`mvn clean install`
	
### How to Run and Test ?

- If you use Maven, run the following command in a terminal window (in the complete directory):
`./mvnw spring-boot:run`
